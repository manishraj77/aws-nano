Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage: less than 10 mins
Since we have a multi zone database, we have the best possible RTO for a single AZ failure. The minimum RTO will be in minutes. In case of any failure the database will failover to next availability zone

Minimum RTO for a single region outage: 15 - 30 mins
In case of single region outage, we have a read replica which can be manually promoted to primary database

Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage: less than 5 mins
Since its a multi zone database, the database will failover but on second thought (after the review), the database (between the availability zones) may have a data gap of few mins as data sync is asynchronous.

Minimum RPO for a single region outage: 15-30 mins
Since we have read replica of the database, the time taken to promote the read replica as main database will be the actual time when the data may not get captured (if primary region goes down)
